Hello there.

I am Simon. I am about 20 years old and I like programming stuff.

I'm currently working at T-Systems as IoT Software Engineer.
Before that I was a dual Student at Deutsche Telekom and studied applied informatics (angewandte Informatik).

I am a full-stack developer, which means that I'm bad at frontend and backend development. I also try to learn how to be a software architect.
I can write bad websites like this in vanilla Typescript (but who tf uses this in a commercial application) and Angular (even Angular.js, although plain JS sucks).
I also pretend to know Java Spring, Spring Boot and Spring Cloud but let's be honest, it's just all about finding that right annotation and let "Spring magic" handle the rest (even though I am exerting a lot of effort to find the ultimate "@DoWhatIWant" annotation I have not been successful yet).
Also I know a few things about Microsoft Azure and AWS.
My personal interests are software architecture (especially scalable architectures) and machine learning ("import tensorflow as tf").

I absolutely hate Javascript. Honestly, it's not even funny (single threaded by design and no type safety???). But I like TypeScript a lot because it fixes almost all issues I have with JS.

When I'm not programming stuff or googling how to program stuff I am a voluntary firefighter. Also I like playing video games. And watching Netflix. Sometimes I do it at the same time. Corona sucks.
